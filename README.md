# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description

A repository with solutions for tasks from the third edition of "Introduction
to Algorithms" book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. As far as I know,
[the book](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=cormen+algorithms&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-34000-13078-0&mkcid=2&keyword=cormen+algorithms&crlp=_&MT_ID=&geo_id=&rlsatarget=kwd-77584422083496%3Aloc-235&adpos=&device=c&mktype=&loc=141195&poi=&abcId=&cmpgn=329851328&sitelnk=&adgroupid=1241348780118607&network=s&matchtype=e&msclkid=b06734aa737517c224835410455374c5&ul_noapp=true)
is not free and publicly available. Even though one might be able to find a
free copy on the Internet, I highly encourage one to get it officialy, from a
shop.

## Disclaimer

- **Book**: this repository contains no information from the actual book. The
only thing one might be able to find here is my suggested solutions for tasks
listed on the book.
- **Language**: the book I own is written in Ukrainian, so all the questions
are translated into English by me, and thus are likely to be much different
from the original ones in terms of structure. The main idea still has to be the
same (at least I try to keep translations consistent).
- **Reliability**: all the solutions available on this repository might have
bugs. They are not necessary (and are very unlikely to be) the easiest /
fastest ones.
